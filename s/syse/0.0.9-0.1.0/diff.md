     Returns:
-        float: The depreciation for the asset.

     .. Note::
         The function takes the same inputs as the declining_balance_method function, but computes the depreciation
         using the double declining balance method. The double declining balance method assumes that the asset
         depreciates by a fixed percentage of its remaining book value each year, but that the rate of depreciation is
         twice the straight-line rate.
 
     Examples:
     ---------
     Suppose a company purchases a printing press for $100,000, with an expected salvage value of $10,000 after 4 years.
     The company expects to use the printing press for 4 years. The depreciation rate for the printing press is 50% per
     year using the double declining balance method. We can compute the depreciation for the printing press using the
-    double function::

         depreciation = syse.double(cost=100000, salvage_value=10000, useful_life=4, rate=0.5)
         print(f"The total depreciation for the printing press over 4 years is ${depreciation:.2f}.")
-        Output = The total depreciation for the printing press over 4 years is $102000.00.
-    This means that the company can deduct $102,000 as a depreciation expense over the 4-year life of the printing
+        Output = The total depreciation for the printing press over 4 years is $90,000.00.
+    This means that the company can deduct $90,000 as a depreciation expense over the 4-year life of the printing
     press for tax purposes. At the end of 4 years, the book value of the printing press will be $10,000, which is the
     expected salvage value.
