 This package allows you to extract and aggregate the relevant values from a
 cfconventions compliant netcdf files given shapefiles.
 
 EASYMORE is a collection of functions that allows extraction of the data from a NetCDF file for a given shapefile such as a basin, catchment, points or lines. It can map gridded data or model output to any given shapefile and provide area average for a target variable.
 
 EASYMORE is very efficient as it uses pandas `groupby` functionality. Remapping of the entire north American domain from ERA5 with resolution of 0.25 degree to 500,000 subbasins of MERIT-Hydro watershed for 7 variables in 1.2 seconds for one time step (the time varying from device to device and depending on the source netCDF files sizes and their temporal aggregation).
 
-In addition, EASYMORE can perform geospatial processes that are often needed for setting up a hydroligcal or land model. These steps are zonal statistics of raster given a shapefile, zonal statistics of two shapefiles, creation of subbasins and river network topology given hydrologically conditioned DEM such as MERIT-Hydro.
-
 ## The code can be used for the following purposes:
 
 1. Remapping the relevant forcing variables, such as precipitation or temperature and other variables for the effortless model set up. This transfer can be from Thiessen polygon or gridded data, for example, to computational units, hydrological model for example.
 2. Remapping the output of a hydrological or land surface model to force another model, such as providing the gridded model output in sub-basin for routing.
 3. Extraction of single or multiple points from the gridded or irregular data for comparison with gauges data, for example.
 4. Interpolation to caorser or finer resolutions with full controllability in creating the interpolation rules.
 
 ## How to install:
 
+**⚠ ATTENTION:**
+We highly recommend before using EASYMORE, the virtual environment is set up properly, and then the examples from the GitHub repository are tested to evaluate the authenticity of the results with what is generated by the EASYMORE development team. Examples and more detailed information on installation is provided in the [env](https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE/tree/main/env) folder.
+
 ### From PyPI:
 
 `pip install easymore`
 
 ### From local repo:
 
 clone the code on your perosnal computer or home on HPC by
 
 ```
-git clone https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE.git`
+git clone https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE.git
 cd EASYMORE
-pip install -r requirements.txt
 pip install .
 ```
 
 ## Flexibilities:
 
-1. EASYMORE allow for commbination of the remapping of NetCDF on local computer or remote high performance computer. For example, the the GIS steps of creating remapping file can be done locally on a sample file that contains few time step of the data (but all the domain). EASYMORE can then be directed to remapping file on the HPC and will skip all the needed GIS steps and directly start remapping process of bulk of the data. For installing without gis packages you can simply do:

 This package allows you to extract and aggregate the relevant values from a
 cfconventions compliant netcdf files given shapefiles.
 
 EASYMORE is a collection of functions that allows extraction of the data from a NetCDF file for a given shapefile such as a basin, catchment, points or lines. It can map gridded data or model output to any given shapefile and provide area average for a target variable.
 
 EASYMORE is very efficient as it uses pandas `groupby` functionality. Remapping of the entire north American domain from ERA5 with resolution of 0.25 degree to 500,000 subbasins of MERIT-Hydro watershed for 7 variables in 1.2 seconds for one time step (the time varying from device to device and depending on the source netCDF files sizes and their temporal aggregation).
 
-In addition, EASYMORE can perform geospatial processes that are often needed for setting up a hydroligcal or land model. These steps are zonal statistics of raster given a shapefile, zonal statistics of two shapefiles, creation of subbasins and river network topology given hydrologically conditioned DEM such as MERIT-Hydro.
-
 ## The code can be used for the following purposes:
 
 1. Remapping the relevant forcing variables, such as precipitation or temperature and other variables for the effortless model set up. This transfer can be from Thiessen polygon or gridded data, for example, to computational units, hydrological model for example.
 2. Remapping the output of a hydrological or land surface model to force another model, such as providing the gridded model output in sub-basin for routing.
 3. Extraction of single or multiple points from the gridded or irregular data for comparison with gauges data, for example.
 4. Interpolation to caorser or finer resolutions with full controllability in creating the interpolation rules.
 
 ## How to install:
 
+**⚠ ATTENTION:**
+We highly recommend before using EASYMORE, the virtual environment is set up properly, and then the examples from the GitHub repository are tested to evaluate the authenticity of the results with what is generated by the EASYMORE development team. Examples and more detailed information on installation is provided in the [env](https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE/tree/main/env) folder.
+
 ### From PyPI:
 
 `pip install easymore`
 
 ### From local repo:
 
 clone the code on your perosnal computer or home on HPC by
 
 ```
-git clone https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE.git`
+git clone https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE.git
 cd EASYMORE
-pip install -r requirements.txt
 pip install .
 ```
 
 ## Flexibilities:
 
-1. EASYMORE allow for commbination of the remapping of NetCDF on local computer or remote high performance computer. For example, the the GIS steps of creating remapping file can be done locally on a sample file that contains few time step of the data (but all the domain). EASYMORE can then be directed to remapping file on the HPC and will skip all the needed GIS steps and directly start remapping process of bulk of the data. For installing without gis packages you can simply do:
-
-
-### From PyPI
-
-`pip install easymore --no-deps -r requirements_basic.txt`
-
-### From local repo:
-
-```
-git clone https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE.git`
-cd EASYMORE
-pip install -r requirements.txt
-pip install . --no-deps -r requirements_basic.txt
-```
