 By default, tulp uses **gpt-3.5-turbo**, because it is cheaper and **faster**, but for complex tasks, it is always a **good idea to force the gpt-4 model**: TULP_MODEL=gpt-4 tulp {a complex task}
 
 ## Configuration 
 The configuration file is located at ~/.tulp.conf. Define your own ~/.tulp.conf file or define the same environment variable but using the prefix TULP_. 
 
 The following are the parameters that can be configured:
-- LOG_LEVEL: The log level of Tulp. Valid options are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. The default value is INFO.
-- OPENAI_API_KEY: The API key for OpenAI. The default value is an empty string.
-- MAX_CHARS: The maximum number of characters processed in one chunk. The default value is 5000.
-- MODEL: The OpenAI model to be used by Tulp. The default value is gpt-3.5-turbo, but gpt-4 is also available.

+- **MODEL**: The OpenAI model to be used by Tulp. The default value is gpt-3.5-turbo, but gpt-4 is also available.

 configuration file is located at ~/.tulp.conf. Define your own ~/.tulp.conf
 file or define the same environment variable but using the prefix TULP_. The
-following are the parameters that can be configured: - LOG_LEVEL: The log level
-of Tulp. Valid options are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. The
-default value is INFO. - OPENAI_API_KEY: The API key for OpenAI. The default
-value is an empty string. - MAX_CHARS: The maximum number of characters
-processed in one chunk. The default value is 5000. - MODEL: The OpenAI model to
-be used by Tulp. The default value is gpt-3.5-turbo, but gpt-4 is also
-available. As environment variables, they will become: TULP_LOG_LEVEL,
-TULP_OPENAI_API_KEY, TULP_MAX_CHARS, or TULP_MODEL. Here is an example
