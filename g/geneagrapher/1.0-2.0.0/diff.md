-Description: # Geneagrapher
-        Geneagrapher is a tool for extracting information from the
-        [Mathematics Geanealogy
-        Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/) to form a
-        geneagraphy. The output is a dot file, which can be used by
-        [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to visualize the tree.
-        
-        ## Basic Concepts
-        The input to the Geneagrapher is a set of starting nodes. If you want
-        to build the ancestor graph of C. Felix Klein, then C. Felix Klein is
-        the starting node for that graph. Multiple starting nodes may be
-        provided (to produce the combined ancestor graph for an academic
-        department, for instance).
-        
-        Each individual stored in the Mathematics Genealogy Project's website
-        has a unique integer as an identifier, and this identifier is what is
-        passed to the Geneagrapher for starting nodes. The identifier is
-        embedded in the URL for records in the Mathematics Genealogy Project
-        website. For example, [Carl
-        Gau√ü](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231) is ID
-        18231 and [Leonhard
-        Euler](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=38586) is ID
-        38586.
-        
-        Before running the Geneagrapher, go to the [Mathematics Genealogy
-        Project](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/) and gather the
-        identifiers of the starting nodes for the graph you have in mind.
-        
-        ## Installation
-        Geneagrapher is installed by pip. If your system does not have pip,
-        see the instructions
-        [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
-        
-        Once pip is available on your system, install Geneagrapher with:
-        ```
-        pip install geneagrapher
-        ```
-        
-        ## Usage
-        After installing the Geneagrapher, running
-        
-        ```
-        ggrapher --help
-        ```
-        
-        should produce
-        
-        ```
-        usage: ggrapher [-h] [--version] [-f FILE] [-a] [-d] [--disable-cache]
-                        [--cache-file FILE] [-v]
-                        ID [ID ...]
-        
-        Create a Graphviz "dot" file for a mathematics genealogy, where ID is a record
-        identifier from the Mathematics Genealogy Project. Multiple IDs may be passed.
-        
-        positional arguments:
-          ID                    mathematician record ID
-        
-        optional arguments:
-          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
-          --version             show program's version number and exit
-          -f FILE, --file FILE  write output to FILE [default: stdout]
-          -a, --with-ancestors  retrieve ancestors of IDs and include in graph
-          -d, --with-descendants
-                                retrieve descendants of IDs and include in graph
-          --disable-cache       do not store records in local cache
-          --cache-file FILE     write cache to FILE [default: geneacache]
-          -v, --verbose         list nodes being retrieved
-        ```
-        
-        Explanations of some of the options are given below, followed by
-        examples.
-        
-        **-f FILE, --file=FILE**
-        
-        By default, the Geneagrapher writes the data it generates to standard
-        output. If you want the data written to file, you need to redirect the
-        output or use the `-f` or `--file` switch. When one of these switches
-        is used, the data is saved in the file name provided.
-        
-        **-a, --with-ancestors**
-        
-        When one of these switches is provided to the Geneagrapher, an
-        ancestor graph is generated. An ancestor graph starts with the
-        starting nodes and the works up to their advisors, their advisors'
-        advisors, and so on.
-        
-        **-d, --with-descendants**
-        
-        These switches instruct the Geneagrapher to extract information about
-        the descendants of the starting nodes (i.e., their advisees, their
-        advisees' advisees, and so on).
-        
-        ## Processing the Dot File
-        To process the generated dot file,
-        [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is needed. Graphviz installs
-        several programs for processing dot files. For the Geneagrapher, I use
-        the dot program. Let's look at an example.
-        
-        If the Geneagrapher has generated a file named "graph.dot", we can do
-        
-        ```
-        dot -Tpng graph.dot > graph.png
-        ```
-        
-        This command produces a PNG file containing the graph. That's really
-        all there is to it. Almost.
-        
-        By default, `dot` renders an image with 96dpi. This can look a little
-        blurry at 100% on high-resolution displays. You might want to increase
-        the resolution. You can do this with the `-Gdpi` flag. For instance,
-        to produce a PNG with 150dpi, you can do
-        
-        ```
-        dot -Tpng -Gdpi=150 graph.dot > graph.png
-        ```
-        
-        ## Examples
-        _Note: the Mathematics Genealogy Project has added new data since the
-        examples below were constructed, so if re-run, the results will look
-        different. The commands, however, all remain correct._
-        
-        ### Single Node Ancestry: Carl Gau&szlig;
-        To produce the ancestry dot file for Carl Gau√ü and save it in the file
-        'gauss.dot', run the command

-        To produce the descendant dot file for Haskell Curry and save it in
-        the file 'curry.dot', run the command

+# Geneagrapher [![Continuous Integration Status](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)
+
+Geneagrapher is a tool for building mathematician advisor-advisee
+genealogies using information from the [Mathematics Genealogy
+Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/). The output is either a DOT
+file, which can be used by [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to
+visualize the graph, or a JSON structure that you can consume with
+other software tools. Here's an example of a genealogy built by
+Geneagrapher and visualized using Graphviz:
+
+<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/v2.0.0/images/chioniadis-geneagraph.png" alt="Chioniadis math
+genealogy" width="480px">
+
+To use this package, you will need to have a Python interpreter on
+your system and install this package. Additionally, if you want to
+generate the graph visualization you will need another tool (e.g.,
+[Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/)).
+
+If you want to build a math genealogy more easily, you may want to
+look at the [Geneagrapher
+notebook](https://observablehq.com/@davidalber/geneagrapher). That
+Observable notebook creates geneagraphs in your browser.
+
+If you want to consume records from the Math Genealogy Project in your
+own software, you may be interested in
+[geneagrapher-core](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher-core).
+
+## Basic Concepts
+The input to the Geneagrapher is a set of starting nodes and traversal
+directions. Multiple starting nodes may be provided (to produce the
+combined graph for an academic department's students and professors,
+for instance).
+
+### Starting Nodes
+Each individual stored in the Mathematics Genealogy Project's website
+has a unique integer as an identifier, and this identifier is what is
+passed to the Geneagrapher to specify a starting node. The identifier
+is contained in the URL for records in the Mathematics Genealogy
+Project website. For example, [Carl
+Gau√ü](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=18231) is ID 18231 and
+[Leonhard Euler](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=38586) is ID
+38586.
+
+Before running the Geneagrapher, go to the [Mathematics Genealogy
+Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/) and gather the identifiers of
+the starting nodes for the graph you want to build.
+
+### Traversal Directions
+For each starting node, you instruct Geneagrapher to traverse in the
+advisor direction, the descendant (i.e., student) direction, or
+both. For example, if you want to build the graph of a mathematician
+and all of their students, you would specify the descendant traversal
+direction for that starting node.
+
+### Syntax
+When running Geneagrapher, you provide starting nodes on the command
+line. The syntax for doing this is `NODE_ID:TRAVERSAL_DIRECTION`,
+where `TRAVERSAL_DIRECTION` is `a | d`, and `a` and `d` indicate
+advisor and descendant traversal, respectively. Here are some
+examples:
+
+- Carl Gau√ü and his advisor graph: `18231:a`.
+- Carl Gau√ü and his descendant graph: `18231:d`.
+- Carl Gau√ü and his advisor and descendant graphs: `18231:ad`.
+
+## Installation
+To install Geneagrapher, you must have Python >= 3.8.1. Geneagrapher
+is installed by pip. If your system does not have pip, see the
+instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
+
+Once pip is available on your system, install Geneagrapher with:
+```
+pip install geneagrapher
+```

+
+## Processing the DOT File
+To process the generated DOT file,
+[Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is needed. Graphviz installs
+several programs for processing DOT files. For the Geneagrapher, use
+the `dot` program. Let's look at an example.
+
+If the Geneagrapher has generated a file named "graph.dot", a PNG file
+containing the graph can be created with the following command.
+
+```
+dot -Tpng graph.dot > graph.png
+```
+
+That's really all there is to it. Almost.
+
+By default, `dot` renders an image with 96dpi. This may not look great
+on high-resolution displays, so you might want to increase the
+resolution. You can do this with the `-Gdpi` flag. For instance, to
+produce a PNG with 150dpi, you can do
+
+```
+dot -Tpng -Gdpi=150 graph.dot > graph.png
+```
+
+Graphviz can also generate other formats, such as PDF and SVG.
+
+## Examples
+Note: the Mathematics Genealogy Project data changes over time, so if
+the examples below are re-run, the results may look different. The
+commands, however, will be the same.

+
+## Technical Details
+Previous versions of Geneagrapher made requests directly to the
+Mathematics Genealogy Project and built the graph in the
+application. The current version of Geneagrapher, however, makes
+requests to an intermediate service that is built using
+[geneagrapher-core](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher-core). This
+backend service assembles requested graphs and maintains a cache of
+records.
+
+While the shared cache substantially reduces the number of requests
+from individuals running Geneagrapher (or the [Geneagrapher
+notebook](https://observablehq.com/@davidalber/geneagrapher)) and
+speeds up the graph-building process, it also creates an opportunity
+for inconsistency between information in the Mathematics Genealogy
+Project and the cache. This can happen when records are updated in the
+Mathematics Genealogy Project. Such inconsistencies will automatically
+be resolved when cached values expire.

+
+Geneagrapher is a tool for building mathematician advisor-advisee
+genealogies using information from the [Mathematics Genealogy
+Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/). The output is either a DOT
+file, which can be used by [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to
+visualize the graph, or a JSON structure that you can consume with
+other software tools. Here's an example of a genealogy built by
+Geneagrapher and visualized using Graphviz:
+
+<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/v2.0.0/images/chioniadis-geneagraph.png" alt="Chioniadis math
+genealogy" width="480px">
+
+To use this package, you will need to have a Python interpreter on
+your system and install this package. Additionally, if you want to
+generate the graph visualization you will need another tool (e.g.,
+[Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/)).
+
+If you want to build a math genealogy more easily, you may want to
+look at the [Geneagrapher
+notebook](https://observablehq.com/@davidalber/geneagrapher). That
+Observable notebook creates geneagraphs in your browser.
+
+If you want to consume records from the Math Genealogy Project in your
+own software, you may be interested in
+[geneagrapher-core](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher-core).
 
 ## Basic Concepts
-The input to the Geneagrapher is a set of starting nodes. If you want
-to build the ancestor graph of C. Felix Klein, then C. Felix Klein is
-the starting node for that graph. Multiple starting nodes may be
-provided (to produce the combined ancestor graph for an academic
-department, for instance).
+The input to the Geneagrapher is a set of starting nodes and traversal
+directions. Multiple starting nodes may be provided (to produce the
+combined graph for an academic department's students and professors,
+for instance).
 
+### Starting Nodes
 Each individual stored in the Mathematics Genealogy Project's website
 has a unique integer as an identifier, and this identifier is what is
-passed to the Geneagrapher for starting nodes. The identifier is
-embedded in the URL for records in the Mathematics Genealogy Project
-website. For example, [Carl
-Gau√ü](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231) is ID
-18231 and [Leonhard
-Euler](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=38586) is ID
+passed to the Geneagrapher to specify a starting node. The identifier
+is contained in the URL for records in the Mathematics Genealogy
+Project website. For example, [Carl
+Gau√ü](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=18231) is ID 18231 and
+[Leonhard Euler](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=38586) is ID
 38586.
 
 Before running the Geneagrapher, go to the [Mathematics Genealogy
-Project](https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/) and gather the
-identifiers of the starting nodes for the graph you have in mind.
+Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/) and gather the identifiers of
+the starting nodes for the graph you want to build.
+
+### Traversal Directions
+For each starting node, you instruct Geneagrapher to traverse in the
+advisor direction, the descendant (i.e., student) direction, or
+both. For example, if you want to build the graph of a mathematician
+and all of their students, you would specify the descendant traversal
+direction for that starting node.
+
+### Syntax
+When running Geneagrapher, you provide starting nodes on the command
+line. The syntax for doing this is `NODE_ID:TRAVERSAL_DIRECTION`,
+where `TRAVERSAL_DIRECTION` is `a | d`, and `a` and `d` indicate
+advisor and descendant traversal, respectively. Here are some
+examples:
+
+- Carl Gau√ü and his advisor graph: `18231:a`.
+- Carl Gau√ü and his descendant graph: `18231:d`.
+- Carl Gau√ü and his advisor and descendant graphs: `18231:ad`.
 
 ## Installation
-Geneagrapher is installed by pip. If your system does not have pip,
-see the instructions
-[here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

-
-Explanations of some of the options are given below, followed by
-examples.
-
-**-f FILE, --file=FILE**
-
-By default, the Geneagrapher writes the data it generates to standard
-output. If you want the data written to file, you need to redirect the
-output or use the `-f` or `--file` switch. When one of these switches
-is used, the data is saved in the file name provided.
-
-**-a, --with-ancestors**
-
-When one of these switches is provided to the Geneagrapher, an
-ancestor graph is generated. An ancestor graph starts with the
-starting nodes and the works up to their advisors, their advisors'
-advisors, and so on.
-
-**-d, --with-descendants**
-
-These switches instruct the Geneagrapher to extract information about
-the descendants of the starting nodes (i.e., their advisees, their
-advisees' advisees, and so on).
